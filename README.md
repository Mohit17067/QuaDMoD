QuadMod comes with 4 features, no one would have ever thought of in a lamp. The four modes are as follows-

**Study Mode** - The lamp is ready whenever you are! QuadMod gets activated if it sees a person around it and go to sleep if
no one is around. It has a PIR sensor and on sensing any motion it comes down.

**Candle Light Mode** - Yes, Quadmod has a feature for couples two. In this mode, it opens its arms and glows two beautiful candle 
shaped leds creating a romantic environment.

**Disco Mode** - The lamp rotates its arms and blinks colourful leds creating a rocking environment. The rotation is done using a 
DC motor.

**Night Mode** - QuadMod glows some dim lights which comes out from tinyholes made on its surface.
